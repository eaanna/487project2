          <h2 class="slidetitle">Be Bear-y Aware</h2>
          <p>Bear management is one of the most important aspects of saving the bear populations in North America.
            American national groups, such as the National Park Service or the US Fish and Wildlife Service, emphasize
            how important it is to be educated about the furry creatures. Education about bear conservation and
            prevention
            of human-bear interaction is essential to future bear survival in North America.</p>

          </div>
          <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: 10pt;">In a response to bears digging through
            trash, parks have implemented "bear proof" trashcans to stop bears from becoming comfortable with and
            associating humans with food.</p>
          <p>Aside from education, wildlife groups use various methods to stop bears from interacting with humans. One
            major method is negative reinforcement during bear encounters. Black and Brown Bears are omnivores, and are
            not picky, choosing to eat anything that smells good and gives them energy. As a result, when habitats
            shrink or a bear wanders too far, human trash is appealing. In an encounter with a bear in backyards, it is
            good practice to make loud noise and scare the bear off. Scaring the bear increases the changes of the bear
            seeing humans negatively and not returning.</p>

                Black and Brown Bears are on the rise, and have seen the greatest efforts in North America.
                Organizations
                such as the World Wildlife Fund, Free the Bears, and the International Bear Association work to conserve
                bear populations globally. Some of the efforts include education and rescue from Asian bile farms and
                circuses where many bears are exploited.</p>

              <p>The International Union for the Conservation of Nature periodically releases a 'red list' that has the
                endangerment levels of plant and animal species across the world. Out of eight bear species, only two
                are of
                least concern, the Black and Brown bear. However, although these bears are of least concern, they may be
                endangered or extinct in some local areas, or may have extinct subspecies. The other six species are
                considered vulnerable.</p>

          <h2 class="slidetitle">What if I encounter a bear?</h2>
          <p>According to an article from Vox Media, only 71 people have been killed in bear attacks in wilderness areas
            in the United States, compared to a total of 158 in North America since 1900. For the millions of people who
            explore nature in North America have a minimal chance of encountering a bear attack, much less a fatal one.
            In general, bears will either charge as a bluff or in aggression. A bluff is typically indicated by the bear
            with its head up and body puffed to
            appear bigger. The bear may charge by running fast in big leaps then veer in a different direction as it
            approaches. In an attack, however, the bear will yawn, clack their teeth, stomp their paws on the ground and
            huff, and their head and ears will be down.</p>
          <p class="slidecaption">In the event that you see a bear around, here are some tips to keep you safe. (Black
            and Brown Bears)</p>
          <div id="bearattackcontent">
            <div id="blufftext">
              <h4 style="text-align: center;">During a Bluff:</h2>
                <p>During a Bluff: slowly back away, raise your arms, and speak to show the bear you are a human. Do
                  not run or continue moving if the bear begins to charge. Move away as soon as the bear stops moving.
                </p>
                <h4 style="text-align: center;">In an Attack:</h2>
                  <p>Brown Bears: PLAY DEAD. Proper form includes laying on the stomach, legs spread, and hands covering
                    the neck and head with the arms. Keep equipment on to keep from more damage. Stay still until the
                    bear leaves and for several minutes after to ensure the bear leaves the area. If the bear persists
                    (a
                    last resort): fight back with any means possible.</p>
                  <p>Black Bears: FIGHT. Aim for the face, such as the nose and eyes. Use any resource as a weapon, such
                    as
                    rocks.</p>

          </div>
          <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: 10pt;">*Note: Polar Bear interactions are
            extremely rare and limited, and they are known carnivores. Those who live in the Arctic Circle and
            surrounding areas are likely to take preventative measures to avoid Polar Bears completely.</p>
